graphical feedback (view clusters, selections, query/filter command generator)
selection cache (save cache of selections you've made)

Fnz bond distance: makes duplicates, filter by type

Julija's dream:
Something about orbitals (plz explain)

Discuss making a strain order parameter deformer (skk)

Next week:
Jonas has some half baked idea for stacking layers


Purpose:
For a give structure and site, find the symmetrically equivalent sites (and add them)

Outline:
 - Read in structure
    - check out Structure.hpp (casm-utils, not casm), for from_poscar function
 - Find factor group of structure
    - (Comes as a MasterSymGroup, i.e. array of SymOp)
 - Introduce new site
    - Create Coordinate/Site from xyz and structure lattice
 - Apply factor group to new site
    - For each SymOp, apply operation to site (Check out Coordinate.hh for how to apply SymOp, use CART not FRAC)
    - Make sure that the ones you add aren't repeated
 - Append or print new sites
